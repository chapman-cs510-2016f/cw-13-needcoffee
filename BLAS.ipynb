    "At the beginning of the code we exploit namespaces to shorten code by using ```\"Using-declaration\"``` to introduce namespace members into other namespaces and block scopes. Then declare three 3x3 matrices of complex numbers ```\"m\"```, ```\"n\"```, and ```\"o\"``` with long double elements. After that we have two for loop iterating over the 3x3 matrices. Starting with the outer loop \"row index\" then inner loop \"column index\" So by this it will loop throw the rows first then the column elements. For the first matrix ```m(r,c) = 3 * r + c;``` its 3 multiply by the index row + the index column. The second matrix its for complex number ```n(r,c) = r + c * 1i;```. The last matrix ```o(r,c) = std::pow(n(r,c), 2);``` its for squaring the matrix ```\"n\"```. \n",
